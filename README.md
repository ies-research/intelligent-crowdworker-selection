## How to execute experiments?
In the following, we describe step-by-step how to execute all experiments presented in the accompanied article. 
As a prerequisite, we assume to have a Linux distribution as operating system and 
[`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) installed on your machine.

1. _Setup Python environment:_
```bash
projectpath$ conda create --name crowd python=3.9
projectpath$ conda activate crowd
```
First, we need to install `torch` with the build (1.13.1). For this purpose, we refer to 
[`pytorch`](https://pytorch.org/). An exemplary command for a Linux operating system would be:
```bash
projectpath$ pip install torch==1.13.1+cu116 torchvision==0.14.1+cu116 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
```
Subsequently, we install the remaining requirements:
```bash
projectpath$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. _Create and download data sets:_ Start jupyter-notebook and follow the instructions in the jupyter-notebook file
[`notebooks/data_set_creation_download.ipynb`](/notebooks/data_set_creation_download.ipynb).
```bash
projectpath$ conda activate crowd
projectpath$ jupyter-notebook
```
3. _Simulate annotators:_ Start jupyter-notebook and follow the instructions in the jupyter-notebook file 
[`notebooks/annotator_simulation.ipynb`](/notebooks/annotator_simulation.ipynb).
```bash
projectpath$ conda activate crowd
projectpath$ jupyter-notebook
```
4. _Execute experiment scripts:_ The files 
`evaluation/letter.sh` and `evaluation/cifar10.sh` corresponds to evaluating MaDL on CIFAR10 and LETTER. Such a 
file consists of multiple commands executing the file [`evaluation/run_experiment.py`](evaluation/run_experiment.py) with 
different configurations. For a better understanding of these possible configurations, we refer to the explanations in 
the file [`evaluation/run_experiment.py`](evaluation/run_experiment.py). Further you need to specify certain paths, e.g., for logging before 
execution. You can now execute such a `bash` script via:
```bash
projectpath$ conda activate crowd
projectpath$ ./evaluation/crowd_letter.sh
projectpath$ ./evaluation/crowd_cifar10.sh
```
Alternatively, you can use the `sbatch` command:
```bash
projectpath$ conda activate crowd
projectpath$ sbatch ./evaluation/letter.sh
projectpath$ sbatch ./evaluation/crowd_cifar10.sh
```

## How to investigate the experimental results?
Once, an experiment is completed, its associated results are saved as a `.csv` file at the directory specified by 
`evaluation.run_experiment.RESULT_PATH`. For getting a summarized presentation of these results, you need 
to start jupyter-notebook and follow the instructions in the jupyter-notebook file 
[`notebooks/evaluation.ipynb`](notebooks/evaluation.ipynb).
```bash
projectpath$ conda activate crowd
projectpath$ jupyter-notebook
```
